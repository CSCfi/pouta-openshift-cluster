## Managing projects lifecycle 
Hereafter are instructions on how to use the projects lifecycle management script according to the [CSC data retention 
policy](https://wiki.eduuni.fi/x/sZ8ID).

It is possible to run the script in two diffrent modes, __AUTO__ and __MANUAL__. In the __MANUAL__
mode, the script will not interact with the data deletion micorservice and it will  rather use the
input arguments to perform a specific lifecycle operation on a specific CSC computing project in 
Rahti.  In the __AUTO__ manual, the script will retrieve from the data deletion micoservice the list
of projects to be suspended (i.e., in the '__grace__' substate) and the list of projects to be
deleted (i.e., in the '__deletedata__' substate) , the projects are then suspended and deleted,
respectively. The default mode is the MANUAL mode.

### Examples:

First, you need to copy the KubeConfig file from the master host to the deployment container:

`$ cd poc/playbooks`

`$ ansible-playbook copy_kubeconfig.yaml`

`$ cd ../scripts/projects-lcm`

Running the script with __AUTO__ mode:


`$ python3 projects_lcm.py --mode AUTO`

Manually suspending a CSC project in Rahti:

`$ python3 projects_lcm.py --mode MANUAL --action SUSPEND --csc-project <csc-project-number>`

Manually unsuspending a CSC project in Rahti:

`$ python3 projects_lcm.py --mode MANUAL --action UNSUSPEND --csc-project <csc-project-number>`

Manually deleting a CSC project from Rahti:

`$ python3 projects_lcm.py --mode MANUAL --action DELETE --csc-project <csc-project-number>`

Print a summary of projects in the data deletion process:

`$ python3 projects_lcm.py --mode MANUAL --action LIST-CLOSED-PROJECTS`

You can also use `--test true` parameter to use the test microservice instead of the production microservice.

`$ python3 projects_lcm.py --mode AUTO --test true`


It is to be noted that it is not possible to delete projects that have not been suspended for at least 90 days.

## Cleaning stale data

When deleting the closed projects from Rahti, their data (persistent volumes) will be retained. You
can use the lifecycle management script to clean this stale data as follows:

`$ python3 projects_lcm.py --mode MANUAL --action CLEAN-PVS`

It is to be noted that the script will delete a persistent volume only if a minimum period of 30 days
has passed since it has been released.
