# Fix: make sure origin-master-controllers have up to date resolv.conf with local resolution
#
# Looks like origin-master-controllers service is not restarted by
# openshift-ansible after configuring local DNS. This leads to
# origin-master-controllers container having an outdated copy before it
# is restarted. Fix this by restarting the service if resolv.conf does not
# contain cluster.local.
